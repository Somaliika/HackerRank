# Algorithmic Toolbox

This is the repo of [the Coursera course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithmic-toolbox) `Algorithmic Toolbox` by University of California San Diego & National Research University Higher School of Economics.

### About this Course
The course covers basic algorithmic techniques and ideas for computational problems arising frequently in practical applications: sorting and searching, divide and conquer, greedy algorithms, dynamic programming. We will learn a lot of theory: how to sort data and how it helps for searching; how to break a large problem into pieces and solve them recursively; when it makes sense to proceed greedily; how dynamic programming is used in genomic studies. You will practice solving computational problems, designing new algorithms, and implementing solutions efficiently (so that they run in less than a second).

## My outcome

- Week 1: Make a stress test comparing to the straightforward algorithm.
- Week 2: Try to create a formula taking notice of the dependencies between input and output.
- Week 3: Represent a problem mathematically. Consider the Greedy algorithm if there is a combinatorial problem.
- Week 4:
  - We can calculate the recursive algorithm complexity with the Master theorem.

  - Divide the scope into a bigger amount of subtasks, but find a way to calculate not all of them. This will decrease the complexity substantially.
  - If we have several parameters to calculate the result (like x and y for a point), presort them both, and divide by one of them.
- Week 5:
